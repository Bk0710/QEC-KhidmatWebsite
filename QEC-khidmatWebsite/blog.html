    <div class="head-row">
        <div class="col-md-12">

            <div class="blog">
                <p class="center">Chinese is often termed as one of the world’s most difficult languages in the world. Another common question learners ask is, how on earth am I supposed to learn this language? *insert dramatic music*. </p>
                <p class="center">Although all concerns are valid and understandable, but learning Chinese is not that difficult as long as you have the right set of tools and a strong will power!</p>
                <p class="center">A bunch of students in Pakistan have decided to take on this challenge and have started this initiative of teaching Chinese online through YouTube where the language of instruction is Urdu. </p>
                <p class="center">Growing up in China, I realized that it was extremely important to know the language if one wanted to connect with people on a personal level. My family was extremely supportive when I decided to learn the language. My first instinct was to go find some Chinese classes. I was successful in my ‘treasure hunt’ but the classes at language centers costed more than gold itself and I was too young (and under qualified) to actually enroll in a university program. I was devastated. Then one day I decided to go to a park where I met a few senior citizens. One of whom spoke amazing English. We had a quick chat and I shared my deepest sorrow of wanting to learn the language but was unsuccessful. She told me she’d help me out but only with verbal communication as her eyesight had deteriorated significantly. I agreed and met with her at a public park where she taught me the basics. Later on she introduced me to her granddaughter who did not speak a word of English but was very keen on making a new friend. Her grandmother told me that I knew enough Chinese to communicate and she’d help me with the writing and reading. I asked her what would she charge. She replied nothing, just a little help with English that’s all. This language exchange was the first and most important stepping stone to my Chinese language journey. </p>
                <p class="center">After a few months my new friend told me about this test called the HSK( Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi- a Chinese proficiency test for foreigners). I was surprised at this because how on Earth could I take a proficiency test without a single language class. She told me to sleep on it and I told my parents. They encouraged me to register for it.  </p>
                <p class="center">From 0 Chines skills in July, I registered for HSK 3( which includes an understanding of about 600 Chinese characters) in November. Taking the test itself was an adventure on it’s own. From missing the public bus once to getting lost twice. I finally made it to the test center at 9 am sharp. A month later the results came and to my surprise I scored a 90% on the test! After that my family moved back to Pakistan which saddened me because I thought that was the end of my Chinese journey but I took another leap of faith and with one little dictionary and a few sample tests I started studying for HSK 5. Waking up everyday at 4 am really paid off when I passed the exam.  </p>
                <p class="center">Many people have helped me and encouraged me to go on this challenging but life changing journey. It is now my turn to give back to my community. I recently shared my desire to give back to the community with my now project partner. When a desire to giving back to the community and a passion to helping people came to together, Quick Easy Chinese emerged. In the current era, only a few people have time to go to language centers and invest time and money into learning a language. Quick Easy Chinese aims to give this opportunity to learn one of the most difficult languages in the world to anyone who has access to the internet and a smartphone/ computer. </p>
                <h1>Halal Food in China</h1>
                <p class="center"> Okay so now, you’ve booked a flight to China or even reached there. After being confused on why people are driving on the other side of the road, you should ask yourself this very important question. What on Earth am I supposed to eat in this country? There are no restaurants that sell chicken tikka, haleem or even halwa puri. Let’s look at a few options that will not break the bank and will be enjoyed by a pakistani. Okay so drumroll you have a few options. One of them is uhhh cooking at home. China has a few markets that offer halal meat.</p>
                <br /><img src="images/blog-image-1.jpeg" alt="halal-food" width="600px" /><br />
                <p class="center"> If you are staying at a hotel, you won’t have the space or the time. So, if cooking at home is not an option, let’s look at other options. One of the easiest choices here would be looking at veg options at restaurants or noodles stands found outside offices because again they are a cheap and healthier alternative to fast food. Vegetable noodles or egg fried rice can be found anywhere in China.</p>
                <br /><img src="images/blog-image-2.jpeg" alt="halal-food" width="600px" /><br />
                <br /><img src="images/blog-image-3.jpeg" alt="halal-food" width="600px" /><br />
                <p class="center">But this might get boring and monotonous. After all, how much vegetable noodles or rice will one eat? So, is there any other option? Yes! Let me introduce you to Uighyer or Xinjiang cuisine. This uighyer cuisine is one of the most famous cuisine in China and it is ideal for Pakistanis. It is spicy, has a distinct taste and most of all, it’s Halal. One can find this cuisine in 2 forms. Either in the form of mutton BBQ carts wandering around city centers or in the form of small noodle shops around every corner. These shops are small family businesses where the entire family works. </p>
                <br /><img src="images/blog-image-4.jpg" alt="halal-food" width="600px" /><br />
                <br /><img src="images/blog-image-6.jpeg" alt="halal-food" width="600px" /><br />
                <p class="center">Many Chinese retaurants also offer halal options. One of the must have dishes when going to China is, Tofu ( dou fu), stir fried potatoes ( tu dou), gong bao ji ding (Kung pao chicken), sun cai yu ( pickled fish) and many others.</p>
